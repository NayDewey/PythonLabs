'''
Write the necessary code calculate the volume and surface area
of a cylinder with a radius of 3.14 and a height of 5. Print out the result.


'''

#pi is 3.14159
#volume of a cylinder is V = (pi)r2h where r is the radius and h is height
#lateral surface area is 2(pi)radius(height)


pi = 3.14159
radius = 3.14
height = 5
volume = pi * radius * 2 * height
lateral_surface_area = 2 * pi * radius * height

print(volume)
print(lateral_surface_area)
